  // Give one example of a situation where it can be problematic.

  // This is called deadlock and it occurs when multiple threads or processes try to access the same variable at the same time
  // One of them can therefore be blocked from making a change to the variable.
  // A situation where this can be problematic is when two threads are trying to access the same variable in a database.

  // c) Threadsafety with atomic variables
